# **Personal Information**
My full name is Andrew Edward Lawton and my SN is S3785495.


### Background
I was born in Australia, but both of my parents migrated here from Sri Lanka in the late 80s. 


### Education
After completeing high school last year I am currently enrolled in an Bachelors Degrees at RMIT in an Information Technology Course. I find myself exploring techonology and the world beneath our fingertips in my sparetime thus my interest in this course. 

### Interest
When I'm not absorbed in this you can either find me with a guitar. While some may consider me a guitar tradgic, I try as best to emulate the smooth tones of John Mayer or the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughn. For those of you who may not know either of these men, class is now in session, enjoy this video of John Mayer.

I hope you enjoyed that, and if you didn't please don't leave, it gets better I promise.

# **Interest in IT**

### Why I.T?
My interest in I.T blossemed when my brother began his studies in Computer Science. I was able to see how he could manipulate and create new programs tailored for himself and for his clients. Being able to create devices and programs specifically for you would be something I would love to do in the future on both a large and small scale. Whilst using premade devices and programs is useful at times, there is something a bit more special about being able to make it yourself from the ground up.

### Why RMIT?
I chose to study at RMIT due to the interconnection between hands-on learning and theoretical learning. As a learner I believe this approach works best for me as it allows for me to become more ready for the industry ahead of me. The CBD is also a bonus and I would love to be able to begin a career located in the Melbourne CBD.

### What do I expect to be equipped after this?
After leaving RMIT I hope to have a solid grasp and understanding of how we as users can use I.T to solve real world problems within the technollgy driven industry. I want to be able to think both outside of the box to create, help and solve problems that can be used to better the world around us. I would love to speicialise in cybersecurity and networking, but am aware furthur study will be required to be a industry leader within this sector.
